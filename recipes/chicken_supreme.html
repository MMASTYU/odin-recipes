            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Heat half the oil and butter in a large non-stick frying pan. Add the onion and a pinch of salt and fry for 10-15 mins or until golden brown and caramelised. Add the bacon, turn up the heat and cook for 5 mins or until golden brown. Add the garlic and cook for 1 min more. Scrape the mixture into a bowl and set aside.</li>
                <li>Heat the remaining oil and butter in the same pan over a medium-high heat. Season the chicken skin and fry, skin-side down, for 8-10 mins or until deep golden brown and crisp. Flip over and fry for 5 mins on the other side.</li>
                <li>Add the onion and bacon mixture back to the pan. Stir through the flour and cook for 2 mins. Pour in the wine, bring to the boil and simmer for a few minutes.</li>
                <li>Stir through the cream and mustard and simmer over a low heat, uncovered, for 5 mins with the chicken skin-side up. Season to taste. Scatter with parsley, if you like, and serve with mashed potatoes and greens.</li>
